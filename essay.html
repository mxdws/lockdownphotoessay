        <h4 class="post-date">10th November 2020</h4>
        <h2>A Photo Essay by Martin Dawson</h2>
        <p>It is November 2020 and the UK has just enforced a nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of the Covid-19 virus.</p>
        <p>The Chinatown area of Soho is usually one of the busiest areas of London, and the restaurants, cafes and shops that exist there rely on the many daily visitors to survive.</p>
        <p>What happens to these establishments in the current extreme environment?</p>
